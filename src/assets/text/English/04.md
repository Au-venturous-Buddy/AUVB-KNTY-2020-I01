Located at the corner of Sct. Tuazon and Sct. Rallos Streets, DEAN & DELUCA Quezon City is adorned with a simple yet modern look, resembling a "glasshouse" type of cafe with its white walls and ceilings, complementing the wooden floors. As soon as you step inside, you would be greeted with a huge bar serving up coffee, tea, pastries, and cakes. And upon reaching the second floor, you would be amazed most especially the wallpaper depicting a mural of New York City.
