<h3>DEAN & DELUCA Baby Back Ribs</h3>
Now for the main event: The DEAN & DELUCA Baby Back Ribs! It consists of two half-slab Baby Back Ribs smothered in DEAN & DELUCA's signature BBQ sauce, and garnished with spring onions. It is also served with two sides: a creamy corn and cabbage coleslaw and your choice of either red rice or fries. The Baby Back Ribs are so huge and meaty, falls off the bone, and its BBQ sauce complements well with the sides! Just make sure you share it with someone. ðŸ™‚
