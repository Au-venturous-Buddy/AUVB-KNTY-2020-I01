<h3>Kansas BBQ Burger</h3>
And then there is DEAN & DELUCA's Kansas BBQ Burger, which comprises of a very thick Angus Beef Patty, topped with tomato, lettuce, cheese, bacon, caramelized onions, and DEAN & DELUCA's signature BBQ Sauce. The burger itself is indeed very greasy yet meaty, but the fries that goes with it is more noteworthy! The fries are crispy on the outside and pillowy on the inside, and as you take a bite of the fries, its zesty flavors immediately explode in your mouth!
