<h3>Matcha Green Tea Latte</h3>
Last on the list is the Matcha Green Tea Latte of DEAN & DELUCA, which is considered also as an unusual offering like the Turmeric Latte (but not so unusual as matcha is already being loved by tea lovers). It indeed has the distinctive matcha taste that one expects, and is very creamy!

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
DEAN & DELUCA really proves itself as a modern and high-end cafe with its simplistic yet elegant interiors! The foods there are really very rich, and their desserts and drinks are the very ones which youâ€™ll definitely come back for!

(And kudos to Bea Alonzo for bringing DEAN & DELUCA to Quezon City!)
