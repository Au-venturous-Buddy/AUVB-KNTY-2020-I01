<h3>3pc Popeyes Chicken Tenders with Biscuit and Drink</h3>
So far, the Popeyes Chicken Tenders are the best chicken tenders I have ever tasted! The texture is very tender and easy to chew, and the very light and airy batter gives its overall flavor some buttery tones! It comes with your choice of any of the following dips: Ranch, Bold BBQ, Mardi Gras (which is actually spicy wasabi mustard), and Gravy (but trust me, the Popeyes Chicken Tenders tastes good already even without the sauce!), drinks, and a biscuit!

The thing is, I really made Popeyes part of my bucket list because I really miss their biscuits! Back when I was a kid, I really like the taste of the biscuits, most especially when drenched in honey sauce! ðŸ™‚
