<h3>Turmeric Latte</h3>
One of the most unusual offerings at DEAN & DELUCA is their Turmeric Latte, which is made with turmeric tea and milk. At first taste, it does taste as if youâ€™re having mustard sauce as your drink! But pair it with a sweet desert like the Valrhona Checkers Cake and the drink begins to taste very mellow! Just make sure to mix the drink well; the turmeric tea powder has the tendency to settle at the bottom. And this drink is healthy!
