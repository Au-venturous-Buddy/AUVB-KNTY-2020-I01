<h3>Carbonara</h3>
Next up is the Carbonara of DEAN & DELUCA. It is just as authentic as it gets, with al dente spaghetti tossed with huge chunks of mushroom and thick-cut bacon and creamy white wine sauce, and topped with a poached egg and served with a slice of garlic bread. Mix all of them up, and the taste of it is very rich and creamy!
