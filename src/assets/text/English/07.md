<h3>Arugula, Pear, and Gorgonzola Salad</h3>
We start things off with the Arugula, Pear, and Gorgonzola Salad. It is a pile of arugula tossed in pieces of candied walnuts, gorgonzola, cranberry, and cherry tomatoes, and topped with caramelized pear slices (which has a distinctive sugar coating), garnished with dill, and drizzled with passion fruit vinaigrette. As a result, the salad tastes really sweet yet slightly toned down with tones of tartness brought about by the cranberries and the vinaigrette. The candied walnuts add a crunchy dimension to the salad, while the gorgonzola adds a bit of creaminess it.
