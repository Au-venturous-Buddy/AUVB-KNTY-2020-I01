<h3>Purple Yam Jam Sourdough Pandesal</h3>
Available for take-out in packs of seven, the Purple Yam Jam Sourdough Pandesal has the sour taste one expects from a typical sourdough bread, yet is toned down by the sweet and flavorful purple yam (ube) jam that is intertwined in this pandesal. The bread itself is elastic when you try to pull it apart! ðŸ™‚
