<h3>Valrhona Checkers Cake</h3>
The Valrhona Checkers Cake at DEAN & DELUCA indeed tastes as good as it looks! It comprises of vanilla and chocolate sponge cakes arranged in a checkerboard formation (in fact, it looks like a chessboard!), filled with buttercream icing, and topped with a rich, silky chocolate ganache! Hence, the cake tastes very balanced!
