One of my favorite fast-food chains back in my childhood days has finally returned here in the Philippines! Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen is definitely a must-try if you're a fan of Southern American cuisine! Be amazed by the eye-popping and bright orange-dominated interior designs, and the brick walls definitely adds a homey feeling to the dining experience here.

By the way, contrary to popular belief, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen is NOT named after Popeye the Sailor Man, but is rather named after the character from the movie "The French Connection".
